4.40Introduction
SPARQL W3C Standard
SPARQL stands for. . .
“SPARQL Protocol And RDF
Query Language”
Current version 1.1 (like RDF , RDFS,
etc.)
Language for querying graphs
and a protocol for doing this over the
web using a SPARQL endpoint
Major difference between 1.0 and
1.1: modifying graphs via SPARQL
(insert, delete etc.)

Describing a resource
Simple query that can be used when no information about a graph’s content is
available.
Example 1
DESCRIBE <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Concordia_University>
Example 2
PREFIX geo: <http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
DESCRIBE ?s

Filtering Information
Use a FILTER to remove results that were matched by WHERE , e.g.:

SELECT ?comment
WHERE {
dbr:Linked_data rdfs:comment ?comment .
FILTER (lang(?comment) = "en")
}
Here, we restrict all matched abstracts to those with an English language tag.
FILTER s can operate on numbers, strings, dates, URIs, or other data types
and support regular expressions.

4.96Linked Data: Design Issues
Origin
First proposed by Tim Berners-Lee in 2006
https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html
What’s a “link”?
Technically, a link is a triple where
the subject IRI is in one graph (namespace) and
the predicate and/or object are in a different graph (namespace)
Types of Links
Identity Link: points to the same object or concept in another knowledge graph
(e.g., Canada in DBpedia and Wikidata)
Relationship Link: points to other objects related to a given one (e.g., from a person
to the city they live in)
Vocabulary Link: between data and their vocabulary term
(e.g., IRI is a foaf:Person ) or between vocabulary terms
(e.g., ex:Student rdfs:subClassOf foaf:Person )

4.97Creating Links
Instance Level
Creating links on the instance level (IRIs):
owl:sameAs Most widely used, but makes strong assumptions about both IRIs
being identical (it is symmetric andtransitive )
rdfs:seeAlso Just a reference, makes no claim about the IRIs being identical
(no speciﬁc semantics)
using vocabularies e.g., skos:exactMatch ,foaf:knows
Schema Level
Two graphs can also be linked on the schema level:
Using owl:equivalentClass andowl:equivalentProperty
Using rdfs:subClassOf andrdfs:subPropertyOf
Using vocabularies, e.g., skos:broadMatch orskos:narrowMatch

4.98Linked Data: Design Issues II
The “four rules”
1Use URIs as names for things.
2Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names.
3When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the standards
(RDF , SPARQL).
4Include links to other URIs, so that they can discover more things.

4.100Summary
Major Points
To create a knowledge base in
LOD-compliant format:
1Make your data “5-star”
2Create URIs following the
guidelines
3Select appropriate
vocabularies
4Extend existing vocabularies
if necessary
5Link your data to other
knowledge graphs
6Publish your knowledge
graph on the web
