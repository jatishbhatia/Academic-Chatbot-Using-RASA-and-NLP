Machine learning  (ML) is a field of study  in artificial intelligence  concern ed with the
development and study of statistical algorithms  that can learn from data  and generalize  to unsee n
data, and thus perform tasks  without explicit instructions .[1] Recently, artificial neural networks
have been able to surpass many previous approaches in performance.[2][3]
Machine learning  approaches have been applied to many fields including natural language
processing , computer vision , speech recognition , email filtering , agriculture , and medicine.[4][5]
ML is known in its application across business problems under the name predictive analytics .
Although not all machine learning is statistically  based, computational statistics  is an important
source of the field's methods.
The math ematical foundations of ML are provided by mathematical optimization  (mathematical
programming) methods. Data mining  is a related (paral lel) field of study,  focusing on exploratory
data analysis  (EDA) through unsupervised learning .[7][8]
From a theoretical viewpoint, probably approxi mately correct (PAC) learning  provides a
framework for describing machine learning.
The term machine learning  was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel , an IBM  employee and pioneer
in the field of computer gaming  and artificial intelligence .[9][10] The synonym self-teaching
computers  was also used in this time period.[11][12]
Although the earliest machine learn ing model was introduced in the 1950s when Arthur Samuel
invented a program  that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side, the history of
machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive
processes.[13] In 1949, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb  published the book The Organization
of Behavior , in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure  formed by certain interactions
among nerve cells.[14] Hebb's model of neurons  interacti ng with one another set a groundwork for
how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes, or artificial neurons  used by
computers to communicate data.[13] Other researchers who have studied  human cognitive systems
contributed to the modern machine  learning technologies as well, inclu ding logician Walter Pitts
and Warren McCulloch , who  proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to com e
up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes.[13]
By the early 1960s an experimental "learning machine" with punched tape  memory, called
Cybertron, had been developed  by Raytheon Company  to analyze sonar  signals,
electrocardiograms , and speech patterns using rudi mentary reinforcement learning . It was
repetitively "trained" by a human operator/teacher to recognize patterns and equipped with a
"goof " button to cause it to re-evaluate incorrect decisions.[15] A repres entative book on research
into machine learning during the 1960s was Nilsson's book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly
with machine learning for pattern  classification.[16] Inte rest related to pattern recog nitionHistory
