History of Communications
Electronic Communications - 	The massive need in relatively short timeThe 1st form of communication between systems were done through magnetic tapesInformation were copied from on system into a tape; which is transferred to another system, possibly a remote oneThe development of the Personal Computer (PC) in the 1980s was a milestone in electronic communication The infusion of millions of PCs into, virtually, everywhere created a further massive need to make information easily accessibleAt this point it was clear that the need for electronic communication was no longer a luxury, rather a necessity and a must 1990s: The World Wide Web (WWW) & The InternetWWW is application that enabled information from around the world to become easily accessible from one’s desk.   The Internet is an electronic network of computers that includes nearly every university, government, and research facility in the world, as well as  many commercial sitesThe Internet started with four interconnected computers in 1969 and was known as ARPAnet

Physical media: twisted pairs
Copper is usually used due to its less resistance to electricity, as well as high resistance to corrosionTwisted wires use balanced signals; 180o out of phase More twists reduce crosstalk, the electromagnetic interference between adjacent pairsAlthough copper has less resistance to electricity, signal will eventually die (attenuate)Repeaters are used to solve this problemTwo types of twisted pair wires exist:Unshielded (UTP) & Shielded (STP); they have different cost & quality

message-switching:Message: unit of informationA route is established when a message is to be sent A sending node attach the message along with the destination address, chooses a route, then forwards it to the first node in that routeThe message, in its entirety, is temporarily stored at that node, while logic is working the next node in the following possible route Once the following node is known the message is routed to itThis is know as Store-and-Forward

packet-switching: hosts break application-layer messages into packetsforward packets from one router to the next, across links on path from source to destinationeach packet transmitted at full link capacity
The network core
1-38
Computer Networks & The Internet
Packet switching has two common routing methodsDatagram Virtual circuit Sending through different routes is flexible; why? However, packets may arrive out of order! With virtual circuit, network protocols establish a route (virtual circuit) before sending any packets.Consequently, packets are guaranteed to arrive in orderImportant Note: The circuit is not dedicated

Packet-switching: store-and-forward
takes L/R seconds to transmit (push out) L-bit packet into link at R bpsstore and forward: entire packet must  arrive at router before it can be transmitted on next link

Bit rate & Bandwidth 
1-46
Bit Rate How many bits per second (bps) a link can transmitRates range from 100s bps to billions of bps (gigabits) and now pushing for trillion bps (terabit) BandwidthPeriod: Time needed for a signal to complete one cycleFrequency: Number of cycles per second, measured in Hertz (Hz) 			f = 1 / p For example, if p = 0.5 microseconds (μsec)    then  f  = 2 MHzA given medium can accommodate a range of frequencyBandwidth is the difference between the highest and the lowest possible frequency that can be transmittedFor example, telephone signals can handle frequencies between 300 Hz & 3300Hz; the bandwidth is hence 3000 HzIn other words, very high or very low audible sounds cannot pass though the telephone

Multiplexing: FDM versus TDM




1-47
Computer Networks & The Internet
Frequency-Division Multiplexing (FDM)
1-48
The signals from all inputs are combined into as a single, more complex analog signalThe channels themselves are separated by a guard band
Computer Networks & The Internet
Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM)
1-49
TDM keeps the signals physically distinct but logically packages them together The optimal performance is achieved when the combined input rate is equal to the output rateA faster combined input rate would result in signals being dropped and a slower input rate would results in frames that are partially full so the channels are underused
Computer Networks & The Internet
Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM)
1-50
T1/DS1 Digital Carrier A standard used for long-distance communication Uses TDM to combine many voice channels into one Digital Signal 1 (DS1) frameT1 refers to the circuit, DS1 refers to the signalDS1 frame has 24 channels of 8 bits each, and one framing bit for synchronization 
DS1 Frame
Computer Networks & The Internet
Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM)
1-51
T1/DS1  Digital Carrier T1 rate:8-bit sample * 8000 samples/second  64 KbpsTo support this rate, T1 must transmit a DS1 frame each 1/8000 seconds  must transmit 8000 * 193 bits each second Date rate of 1.544 Mbps (1.536 Mbps  of  actual data) This rate is considered slow compared to optical fiber capabilitiesThat is the reason there are other carriers with more channels and faster bit rateT1 is not only used for voice communication; other companies lease phone lines to transfer digital information between computers
Computer Networks & The Internet
Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM)
1-52
ExampleAssume a TDM with 24 slots TDM and a bit rate of 1.536 Mbps. Assume also that end-to-end circuit establishment requires 500 ms.How much time is needed to send a file of size 960 Kbits?
 Each circuit is capable of transmitting 1.536 Mbps/24 = 64kbps To send 960 kbits it requires: 960 kbits/64 kbps = 15 seconds Total time needed to send the file: 15.5 seconds
Computer Networks & The Internet
Packet switching versus circuit switching
example:1 Mb/s linkeach user: 100 kb/s when “active”active 10% of timecircuit-switching: 10 userspacket switching: with 35 users, probability > 10 active at same time is found to be less than .0004 *probability of <= 10 active users at the same time is .9996  packet switching provides essentially the same performance of circuit switching while allowing more than 3 times the number of users
packet switching allows more users to use network!

Protocol “layers” – The ISO OSI Vision 
Networks are complex,with many “pieces”:hostsrouterslinks of various mediaapplicationsprotocolshardware, software
Question: is there any hope of organizing structure of network?…. or at least our discussion of networks?

Open Systems & The OSI Model 
Open system: A set of protocols that would allow any two different systems to communicate regardless of their underlying architectureThe Open System Interconnect (OSI) Model:Introduced by ISOEmploys 7 layers, where each layer performs specific functions and communicate with the one above and below it (service model) Higher layers deal more with the user applications, services and activities Lower layers deal more with the actual transmission of informationAdvantages of layered model?

Layering of airline functionality
layers: each layer implements a servicevia its own internal-layer actionsrelying on services provided by layer below
1-81
Computer Networks & The Internet
Why layering?
dealing with complex systems:explicit structure allows identification, relationship of complex system’s pieceslayered reference model for discussionmodularization eases maintenance, updating of systemchange of implementation of layer’s service transparent to rest of systeme.g., change in gate procedure doesn’t affect rest of systemlayering considered harmful?

Network security
A central topic in the field of computer networking todayfield of network security:how bad guys can attack computer networkshow we can defend networks against attackshow to design architectures that are immune to attacksInternet not originally designed with (much) security in mindoriginal vision: “a group of mutually trusting users attached to a transparent network” Internet protocol designers playing “catch-up”security considerations in all layers!

Bad guys: put malware into hosts via Internet
malware can get in host from:virus: self-replicating infection by receiving/executing  object (e.g., e-mail attachment)worm: self-replicating infection by passively receiving object that gets itself executed (i.e. by running a vulnerable network application to which an attacker can send malware without user interventions)spyware malware can record keystrokes, web sites visited, upload info to collection siteinfected host can be enrolled in  botnet, used for spam. DDoS attacks
1-88
Computer Networks & The Internet
Denial of Service (DoS): attackers make resources (server, bandwidth) unavailable to legitimate traffic by overwhelming resource with bogus traffic
1. select target
2. break into hosts around the network (see botnet)
3. send packets to target from compromised hosts
Bad guys: attack server, network infrastructure
1-89
Computer Networks & The Internet
Most DoS attacks fall in one of three categories:Vulnerability attack: sending well-crafted messages to the vulnerable application resulting in it being stopped or crashedBandwidth flooding: sendtoo many packets that theaccess link to the server becomes clogged, preventing other packets from reaching the serverConnection flooding: establish manyopen TCP connections that theserver stops accepting any further connections
Bad guys: attack server, network infrastructure

Computer Networks & The Internet
Bad guys can sniff packets
packet “sniffing”: broadcast media (shared ethernet, wireless)promiscuous network interface reads/records all packets (e.g., including passwords!) passing by

Computer Networks & The Internet
Bad guys can use fake addresses
IP spoofing: send packet with false source address, hence fooling the receiver as if the message was from a trusted sender
… lots more on security to come
