Example conceptual diagramKnowledge graph
In knowledge repres entation and reasoning , a knowledge
graph  is a knowledge base  that uses a graph -structured data
model  or topology  to represent and operate on data . Knowledge
graphs are often used to store interlinked descriptions of
entities  – objects, events, situations or abstract concepts –
while also encoding the semantics  or relationships underlying
these entities.[1]
Since the development of the Semantic Web , knowledge graphs
have often been associated with linked open data  projects,
focusing on the connections between concepts  and
entities.[2][3] They are also historically associated  with and used by search engines  such as Google ,
Bing , Yext  and Yahoo ; knowledge-engines  and ques tion-answering services such as WolframAlpha ,
Apple's Siri, and Amazon Alexa ; and social networks  such as LinkedIn  and Facebook .
Recent developments in data science and machine learning, particularly in graph neural networks
and representation learning, have broadened the scope of knowledge graphs beyond their
traditional use in search engines and recommender systems. They are increasingly used in
scientific research, with notable applications in fields such as genomics, proteomics, and systems
biology.[4]
The term  was coined as early as 1972 by the Austrian linguist  Edgar W. Schneider , in a discussion
of how to build modular instruction al systems for courses.[5] In the late 1980s, the University of
Groningen  and University of Twente  jointly began a project called Knowledge Graphs, focusing on
the design of semantic network s with  edges restri cted to a limited set of relations, to facilitate
algebras on the graph . In subsequent decades, the distinction between semantic networks and
knowledge graphs was blurred.
Some early knowledge graphs were topic-specific. In 1985, Wordnet  was founded, capturing
semantic relations hips between words and meanings – an application  of this idea to language
itself. In 2005, Marc Wirk found ed Geonames  to capt ure relat ionships between different
geographic names  and locales and associated entities. In 1998 Andrew Edmonds of Science in
Finance Ltd in the UK created a system called ThinkBase that offered fuzzy-logic  based reasoning
in a graphical context.[6]
In 2007, both DBpedia  and Freebase  were founded as graph-based knowledge repositories  for
general-purpose knowledge. DBpedia focused exclusively on data extrac ted from Wikipedia, while
Freebase also included a range of public datasets. Neither described themselves as a 'knowledge
graph' but developed and described related concepts.
In 2012, Google introduced their Knowledge Graph ,[7] building on DBpe dia and Freebase among
other sources. They later incorporated RDFa , Microdata , JSON-LD  cont ent extracted from indexed
web pages, including the CIA World Factbook , Wikidata , and Wikipedia .[7][8] Entity and
relationship types associated with this knowledge graph have been further organized using termsHistory

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph 2/7from the schema.org[9] vocabulary. The Google Knowle dge Graph became a successful
complement to string-based search within Google, and its popularity online brought the term into
more common use.[9]
Since then, several large multinationals have advertised their knowledge graphs use, further
popularising the term. These include Facebook, LinkedIn, Airbnb , Microsoft , Amazon , Uber  and
eBay .[10]
In 2019, IEEE  combined its annual international conferences on "Big Knowledge" and "Data
Mining and Intelligent Computing" into the International Conference on Knowledge Graph.[11]
There is no single commonly accepted definition of a knowledge graph. Most definitions view the
topic through a Semantic Web lens and include these features:[12]
Flexible relations among knowledge in topical domains : A knowledge graph (i) defines abstract
classes  and relations of entities in a schema, (ii) mainly describes real world entities and their
interrelations, organized in a graph, (iii) allows for potentially interrelating arbitrary entities with
each other , and (iv) covers various topical domains.[13]
General structure : A network of entities, their semantic types, properties, and
relationships.[14][15] To represent properties, categorical or numerical values are often used.
Supporting reasoning over inferred ontologies : A knowledge graph acquires and integrates
information into an ontology and applies a reasoner to derive new knowledge.[2]
There are, however, many knowledge graph representations for which some of these features are
not relevant. For those knowledge graphs, this simpler definition may be more useful:
A digital structure that represents knowledge as concepts and the relationships between them
(facts). A knowledge graph can include an ontology that allows both humans and machines to
understand and reason about its contents.[16][17]
In addition to the above examples, the term has been used to describe open knowledge projects
such as YAGO  and Wikidata; federations like the Linked Open Data cloud;[18] a range of
commercial search  tools, including Yahoo's semantic search assistant Spark, Google's Knowledge
Graph , and Microsoft's Satori; and the LinkedIn and Facebook entity graphs.[2]
The term is also used in the context of note-taking software  appl ications that allow a user to build a
personal knowledge graph .[19]
The popularization of knowledge graphs and their accompanying methods have led to the
development of graph databases such as Neo4j[20] and GraphDB.[21] These graph databases allow
users to easily store data as entities their interrelationships, and facilita te operations such as data
reasoning, node embedding, and ontology development on knowledge bases.
A knowledge graph formally represents semantics by describing entities and their relationships.[22]
Knowledge graphs may make use of ontologies  as a schema layer. By doing this, they allow logical
inference  for retrieving implicit knowledg e rather than only allowing queries requesting explicitDefinitions

Two hypothetical knowledge graphs representing disparate topics contain
a node that corresponds to the same entity in the real world. Entity
alignment is the process of identifying such nodes across multiple graphs.knowledge.[23]
In order to allow the use of knowled ge graphs in various machine learni ng tasks, several methods
for deriving latent feature represen tations of entities and relations have been devised. These
knowledge graph embeddings allow them to be connected to machine learning methods that
require feature vectors like word emb eddings . This can complem ent other estimates of conceptual
similarity.[24][25][26]
Models for genera ting useful knowledge graph embeddings are commonly the domain of graph
neural networks (GNNs).[27] GNNs are deep learning architectures that comprise edges and nodes,
which correspond well to the entities and relationships of knowledge graphs. The topology and
data structures afforded by GNNS provides a convenient domain for semi-supervised learning,
wherein the network is trained to predict the value of a node embedding (provided a group of
adjacent nodes and their edges) or edge (provided a pair of nodes). These tasks serve as
fundamental abstractions for mor e complex tasks such as knowled ge graph reasoning and
alignment.[28]
As new knowledge graphs are
produced across a variety of
fields and contexts, the same
entity will inevitably be
represented in multiple graphs.
However, becaus e no single
standard for the construction or
representation of knowledge
graph exists, resolving which
entities from disparate graphs
correspond to the same real
world subject is a non-trivial
task. This task is known as
knowledge graph entity
alignment , and is an active area
of research.[29]
Strategies for entity alignment generally seek to identify similar substructures, semantic
relationships, shared attributes, or combinations of all three between two distinct knowledge
graphs. Entity alignment methods  use these structural similarities between generally non-
isomorphic graphs to predict which nodes corresponds to the same entity.[30]
The recent successes of large language models (LLMs), in particu lar their effectiveness at
producing syntactically meaningful embeddings, has spurred the use of LLMs in the task of entity
alignment.[31]Entity alignment
