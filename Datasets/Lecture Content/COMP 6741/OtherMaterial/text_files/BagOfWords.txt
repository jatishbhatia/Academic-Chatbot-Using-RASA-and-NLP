In computer vision , the bag-of-words model  (BoW model) sometimes called bag-of-visual-
words model  [1][2] can be applied to image classification  or retrieval , by treating image features
as words. In document classification , a bag of words  is a sparse vector  of occurrence counts of
words; that is, a sparse histogram  over  the vocabulary. In computer vision , a bag of visual words  is
a vector of occurrence counts of a vocabulary of local image features.
To represent an image using the BoW model, an image can be treated as a document. Similarly,
"words" in images need to be defined too. To achieve this, it usually includes following three steps:
feature detection , feature description, and codebook generation. [1][2][3] A definition of the BoW
model can be the "histogram representation based on independent features".[4] Content based
image indexing and retrieval (CBIR)  appears to be the early adopter of this image representation
technique.[5]
After feature detec tion, each image is abstracted by several local patches. Feature representation
methods deal with how to represen t the patches as numerical vectors . These vectors are called
feature descriptor s. A good descript or should have the ability to handle intensity, rotation, scale
and affine  variatio ns to some extent. One of the most famous descriptors  is Scale-invariant feature
transform  (SIFT).[6] SIFT converts each patch to 128-dimensional vector. After this step, each
image is a collection of vectors of the same dimension (128 for SIFT), where the order of different
vectors is of no importance.
The final step for the BoW model is to convert vector-represented  patches to "codewords"
(analogous to words in text documents), which also produces a "codebook" (analogy to a word
dictionary). A codeword can be considered as a representative of several similar patches. One
simple method is performing k-means clusterin g over all the vectors.[7] Codewords are then
defined as the centers of the learned clusters. The number of the clusters is the codebook size
(analogous to the size of the word dictionary).
Thus, each patch in an image is mapped to a certain codeword through the clustering process and
the image can be represented by the histogram  of the codewords.Image representation based on the BoW model
