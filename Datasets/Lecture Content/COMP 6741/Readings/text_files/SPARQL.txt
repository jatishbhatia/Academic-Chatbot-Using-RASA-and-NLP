SPARQL  (pronou nced "sparkle ", a recursive acronym[2] for
SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language ) is an RDF
query language —that is, a semantic  query language  for
databases —able to retrieve and manipulate  data stored in
Resource Descript ion Framework (RDF)  format.[3][4] It was
made a standard by the RDF Data Access Working Group
(DAWG) of the World Wide Web Consortium , and is
recognized as one of the key technologies of the semantic web.
On 15 January 2008, SPARQL 1.0 was acknowledged by W3C
as an official recommendation,[5][6] and SPARQL 1.1 in March,
2013.[7]
SPARQL allows for a query to consist of triple patterns ,
conjunctions , disjunctions , and optional patterns .[8]
Implementations for multiple programming languages  exist.[9]
There exist tools that allow one to connect and semi-automatically constr uct a SPARQL query for a
SPARQL endpoint, for example ViziQuer.[10] In addition, tools exist to translate SPARQL queries
to other query languages, for example to SQL[11] and to XQuery .[12]
SPARQL allows users to write querie s against what can loosely be called "key-value" data or, more
specifically, data that follow the RDF  specifica tion of the W3C . Thus, the entire database is a set of
"subject-predicate-object" triples. This is analogous to some NoSQL  data bases' usage of the term
"document-key-value", such as MongoDB .
In SQL  relational database  terms, RDF  data can also be considered a table with three columns –
the subje ct column, the predicate column, and the object column. The subject in RDF is analogous
to an entity in a SQL data base , where the data elements (or fields) for a given business object  are
placed in multiple columns, sometimes spread across more than one table, and identified by a
unique key. In RDF,  those fields are instead represented as separate predicate/object rows sharing
the same  subject, often the same unique key, with the predicate being  analogous to the column
name and the object the actual data. Unlike relational databases, the object column is
heterogeneous: the per-cell data type is usually implied (or specified  in the ontology ) by the
predicate  value. Also unlike SQL, RDF can have multiple entries per predicate; for instance, one
could have multiple "child" entries for a single "person", and can return collections of such objects,
like "children".
Thus, SPARQL provides a full set of analytic query operations such as JOIN , SORT , AGGREGATE  for
data who se schema  is intrinsically part of the data rather than requiring a separate schema
definition. Howev er, schema information (the ontology) is often prov ided externally, to allow
joining of different  datasets  unambig uously. In addition, SPARQL provides specific graph  traversal
syntax for data that can be thought of as a graph.Advantages
