Representing images on multiple layers of
abstraction in deep learning[1]Deep learning
Deep learning  is the subset of machine learning
methods based on artificial neural networks  (ANNs)
with representation learning . The adjective "deep"
refers to the use of multiple layers in the network.
Methods used can be either supervised , semi-
supervised  or unsupervised .[2]
Deep-learning architectures such as deep neural
networks , deep belief networks , recurrent neural
networks , convolutional neural networks  and
transformers  have been applied to fields including
computer vision , speech recognition , natural
language processing , machine translation ,
bioinformatics , drug design , medical image
analysis , climate science , materia l inspection and
board game program s, where  they have produ ced
results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance.[3][4][5]
Artificial neural networks were inspi red by information processing and distributed communication
nodes in biological systems . ANNs have various differences from biological brains. Specifically,
artificial neural networks tend to be static and symbolic, while the biolo gical brain of most living
organisms is dynamic (plastic) and analog.[6][7] ANNs are general ly seen as low quality models for
brain function.[8]
Deep learning is a class of machine learning  algorithms  that[9]: 199â€“200  uses multiple layers to
progressively extra ct higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing ,
lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human
such as digits or letters or faces.
From another angle to view deep learning, deep learning refers to "computer-simulate" or
"automate" human  learning processes from a source (e.g., an image of dogs) to a learned object
(dogs). Therefore, a notion coined as "deeper" learning or "deepest" learning[10] makes sense. The
deepest learning refers to the fully automatic learning from a source to a final learned object. A
deeper learning thus refers to a mixed learning process: a human learning process from a source to
a learned semi-object, followed by a computer learning process from the human learned semi-
object to a final learned object.
Most mod ern deep  learning models are based on multi-layered artificial neural networks  such as
convolutional neural networks  and transformers , althoug h they can also include propositional
formulas  or latent  variables organized layer- wise in deep generative models  such as the nodes in
deep belief networks  and deep Boltzmann machines .[11]Definition
