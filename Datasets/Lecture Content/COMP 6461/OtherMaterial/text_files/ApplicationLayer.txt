An application layer  is an abstraction layer  that specifies the shared communication protocols  and interface  methods  used by hosts  in a
communications network.[1] An application layer  abst raction is specified in both the Internet Protocol Suite  (TCP /IP) and the OSI model .[2] Alth ough
both models use the same term for their respective highest-level layer, the detailed definitions and purposes are different.[3]
In the Internet protocol suite, the application layer contains the communications protocols and interface methods used in process-to-pro cess
communications across an Internet Protocol  (IP) com puter network.[4] The appl ication layer only standardizes communication and depends upon the
underlying transport layer  protocols to estab lish host-to-host data transfer channels and manage the data exchange in a clientâ€“server  or peer-to-peer
networking model.[5] Though the TCP/IP application layer does not describe specific rules or data formats that applications must consider when
communicating, the original specification (in RFC  1123  (https:// datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1123) ) does rely on and recommend the robustness
principle  for application design.[6][7]
In the OSI model , the definition of the application layer is narrower in scope.[9] The OSI model defines the application layer as only the interface
responsible for communicating with host-based and user-facing applications.[10] OSI then explicitly distinguishes the functionality of two additional
layers, the session layer and presentation layer , as separate levels below the applic ation layer and above the transport layer. OSI specifies a strict
modular separation of functionality at these layers and provides protocol implementations  for each. In contrast, the Internet Protocol Suite compiles
these functions into a single layer.[10]
Originally the OSI model consisted of two kinds of application layer services with their related protocols.[11] These two sublay ers are the common
application service  element (CASE) and specific application service element (SASE).[12] Generall y, an application layer prot ocol is realized by the use
of the functionality of a number of application service elements.[13] Som e application service elements invoke different procedures based on the
version of the session service available.[14]
The common application service element sublayer provides services for the application layer and request services from the session layer. It provides
support for common application services, such as:
ACSE ( Association Control Service Element )[12]
ROSE (Remote Operation Service Element)
CCR (Commitment Concurrency and Recovery)
RTSE (Reliable Transfer Service Element)
The specific application service element sublayer provides application-specific services (protocols), such as:
FTAM (File Transfer , Access and Manager)
VT (Virtual Terminal)
MOTIS (Message Oriented Text Interchange Standard)
CMIP  (Common Management Information Protocol)
JTM (Job Transfer and Manipulation)[15]
MMS  (Manufacturing Messaging Specification)
RDA (Remote Database Access)
DTP (Distributed Transaction Processing)
The IETF definition document for the application layer in the Internet Protocol Suite is RFC 1123. It provided an initial set of protocols that covered
the major aspects of the functionality of the early Internet :[6]
Hypertext documents: Hypertext Transfer Protocol  (HTTP)
Remote login to hosts: Telnet , Secure Shell
File transfer: File Transfer Protocol  (FTP), Trivial File Transfer Protocol  (TFTP)
Electronic mail transport: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol  (SMTP)
Networking support: Domain Name System  (DNS)
Host initialization: BOOTP
Remote host management: Simple Network Management Protocol  (SNMP), Common Management Information Protocol  over TCP (CMOT)
Additional notable application-layer protocols include the following:Internet protocol suite

Examples
Internet Relay Chat  (IRC )
is a text-based chat system for
instant messaging. IRC is
designed for group
communication in discussion
forums, called channels , but
also allows one-on-one
communication via private
