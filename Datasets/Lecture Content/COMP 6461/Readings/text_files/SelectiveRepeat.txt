(Redirected from Selective repeat )
Selective Repeat ARQ  or Selective Reject ARQ  is a specific instan ce of the automatic repeat
request  (ARQ) protocol used to manage sequence numbers and retransm issions in reliable
communications .
Selective Repeat is part of the autom atic repeat request (ARQ). With selective repeat, the sender
sends a number of frames specified by a window size even without the need to wait for individual
ACK from  the receiver as in Go-Back-N ARQ . The receiver may selectively reject  a single frame,
which may be retransmitted alone; this contrasts with other forms of ARQ, which must send every
frame from that point again. The receiver accepts out-of-order frame s and buffers them. The
sender individually retransmits frames that have timed out.
It may be used as a protocol for the delivery and acknowledgement of message units, or it may be
used as a protocol for the delivery of subdivided message sub-units.
When used as the protocol for the delivery of messages , the sending process continues to send a
number of frames  specified by a window size even after a frame loss. Unlike Go-Back-N ARQ , the
receiving process will continue to accept and acknowledge  frames sent after an initial error; this is
the general case of the sliding window protocol  with both transm it and receive window sizes
greater than 1.
The receiver process keeps track of the sequence number of the earliest frame it has not received,
and sends that number with every acknowledgement  (ACK) it sends. If a frame from the sender
does not reach the receiver, the sender continues to send subsequent frames until it has emptied its
window . The receiver continues to fill its receiving window with the subsequen t frames, replying
each time with an ACK containing the sequence number of the earliest missing frame . Once the
sender has sent all the frames in its window , it re-sen ds the frame number given by the ACKs, and
then continues where it left off.
The size of the sending and receiving windows must be equal, and half the maximum sequence
number (assumin g that sequence numbers are numbered from 0 to n−1) to avoid
miscommunication in all cases of packets being dropped. To understand this, consider the case
when all ACKs are destroyed. If the receiving window is larger than half the maximum sequence
number, some, possibly even all, of the packets that are present after timeouts are duplicates that
are not recognized as such. The sender moves its window for every packet that is acknowledged.[1]
When used as the protocol for the delivery of subdivided mes sages  it works somewhat
differently. In non-continuous channels where messages may be variable in length, standard ARQ
or Hybri d ARQ protocols may treat the message as a single unit. Alternately selective
retransmission may be employed in conjunction with the basic ARQ mechanism where the
message is first subdivided into sub-blocks (typically of fixed length) in a process called packetSummary

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_Repeat_ARQ 2/3segmentation . The original variable length messa ge is thus represented as a concatenation of a
variable number of sub-blocks. While in standard ARQ the message as a whole is either
acknowledged (ACKed) or negatively  acknowledged (NAKed), in ARQ with selective transmission
the ACK response would additiona lly carry a bit flag indicating the identity of each sub-block
successfully received. In ARQ with selective retransmission of sub-divided messages each
retransmission diminishes in length, needing to only contain the sub-blocks that were linked.
In most channel models with variable length messages, the probabili ty of error-free reception
diminishes in inverse proportion with increasing message length. In other words, it's easier to
receive a short message than a longer message. Therefore, standard ARQ techniques involving
variable length messages have increased difficulty delivering longer messages, as each repeat is the
full length . Selective re-transmission applied to variable length messages completely eliminates the
difficulty in delivering longer messag es, as successfully delivered sub-blocks are retained after each
transmission, and the number of outstanding sub-blocks in following transmissions diminishes.
Selective Repeat is implemented in UDP transmission.
The Transmission Control Protocol  uses a variant of Go-Back-N ARQ  to ensu re reliable
transmission of data over the Internet Protocol , which does not provide guaranteed delivery of
packets; with Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) extension , it may also use Selective Repeat ARQ.
The ITU-T  G.hn  standard, which provides a way to create a high-speed (up to 1 Gigabit/s) Local
area network  using existing home wiring (power lines , phone lines and coaxial cables ), uses
Selective Repeat ARQ to ensure reliable transmission over noisy media. G.hn  employs packet
segmentation  to sub-divide messages into smaller units, to increase the probability that each one is
received correctly.
The STANAG 5066  Profile for High Frequency (HF) Radio Data Communication uses selective
repeat ARQ, with a maximum window size of 128 protocol-data units (PDUs).
