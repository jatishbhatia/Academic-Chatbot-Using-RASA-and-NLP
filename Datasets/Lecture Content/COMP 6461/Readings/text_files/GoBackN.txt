(Redirected from Go back n )
Go-Back- N ARQ  is a specific instan ce of the automatic repeat request  (ARQ) protocol, in which
the sending process continues to send a number of frames  specified by a window size even without
receiving an acknowledgement  (ACK) packet from the receiver. It is a special case of the general
sliding window protocol  with the transmit  window size of N and receive windo w size of 1. It can
transmit N frames to the peer before requiring an ACK.
The receiver process keeps track of the sequence number of the next frame it expects to receive. It
will discard any frame that does not have the exact sequence number it expects (either a duplicate
frame it already acknowledged, or an out-of-order frame it expects to receive later) and will send
an ACK for the last correct in-order frame.[1] Once the sender has sent all of the frames in its
window , it will detect that all of the frames since the first lost frame are outstanding , and will go
back to the seque nce number of the last ACK it received from the receiver process and fill its
window starting with that frame and continue the process over again.
Go-Back- N ARQ is a more efficient use of a connection than Stop-and-wait ARQ , since unlike
waiting for an acknowledgement for each packet, the connection is still being utilized as packets
are being sent. In other words, during the time that would otherwis e be spent waiting, more
packets are being sent. However, this method also results in sending frames multiple times – if any
frame was lost or damaged, or the ACK acknowledging them was lost or damaged, then that frame
and all following frames in the send window (even if they were received  without error) will be re-
sent. To avoid this, Selective Repeat ARQ  can be used.[2]
These examples assume an infinite number of sequence and request numbers.[1]
N  := window size
Rn := request number
Sn := sequence number
Sb := sequence base
Sm := sequence max
function receiver is
    Rn := 0
    Do the following forever:
        if the packet received = Rn and the packet is error free then
            Accept the packet and send it to a higher layer
            Rn := Rn + 1
        else
            Refuse packet
        Send a Request for Rn
function sender is
    Sb := 0
    Sm := N + 1
    Repeat the following steps forever:
        if you receive a request number where Rn > Sb then
            Sm := (Sm − Sb) + Rn
            Sb := Rn
        if no packet is in transmission thenPseudocode

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go-Back-N_ARQ 2/2            Transmit a packet where Sb ≤ Sn ≤ Sm.  
            Packets are transmitted in order.
There are a few things to keep in mind when choosing a value for N:
1. The sender must not transmit too fast. N should be bounded by the receiver ’s ability to process
packets.
2. N must be smaller than the number of sequence numbers (if they are numbered from zero to
N) to verify transmission in cases of any packet (any data or ACK packet) being dropped.[2]
3. Given the bounds presented in (1) and (2), choose N to be the largest number possible.[3]
