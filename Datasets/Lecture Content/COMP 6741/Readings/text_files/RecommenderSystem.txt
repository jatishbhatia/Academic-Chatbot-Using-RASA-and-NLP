A recommender system , or a recommendation system  (som etimes replacing "system" with
terms such as "platform", "engine", or "algorithm"), is a subclass of information filteri ng system
that provides suggestions for items that are most pertinent to a particular user.[1][2] Reco mmender
systems are particularly useful when an individual needs to choose an item from a potentially
overwhelming number of items that a service may offer.[1][3]
Typically, the suggestions refer to various decision-making processes, such as what product to
purchase, what music to listen to, or what online news to read.[1] Recommender systems are used
in a varie ty of areas, with commonly recognised examples taking the form  of playlist  generators for
video and music services, product recommenders for online stores, or content recommenders for
social media platforms and open web content recommenders.[4][5] These systems can operate
using a single type of input, like music, or multiple inputs within and across platforms like news,
books and search queries. There are also popular recommender systems for specific topics like
restaurants and online dating. Recomm ender systems have also been developed to explore
research articles and experts,[6] collaborators,[7] and financial services.[8]
Recommender systems usually make use of either or both collaborative filter ing and cont ent-based
filtering (also known as the perso nality-based approach), as well as other systems such as
knowledge-based systems . Collaborative filtering approaches  build a model from a user's past
behavior (items previously purchase d or selected and/or numerical ratings given to those items) as
well as similar decisions made by other users. This model is then used to predict items (or ratings
for items) that the user may have an interest in.[9] Content-based filtering approaches utilize a
series of discrete, pre-tagged characteristics of an item in order to recommend additional items
with similar properties.[10]
We can demonstrate the differences between collaborative and content-based filtering by
comparing two early music recommender systems â€“ Last.fm  and Pandora Radio .
Last.fm creates a "station" of recommended songs by observing what bands and individual
tracks the user has listened to on a regular basis and comparing those against the listening
behavior of other users. Last.fm will play tracks that do not appear in the user's library , but are
often played by other users with similar interests. As this approach leverages the behavior of
users, it is an example of a collaborative filtering technique.[11]
Pandora uses the properties of a song or artist (a subset of the 400 attributes provided by the
Music Genome Project ) to seed a "station" that plays music with similar properties. User
feedback is used to refine the station's results, deemphasizing certain attributes when a user
"dislikes" a particular song and emphasizing other attributes when a user "likes" a song. This is
an example of a content-based approach.
Each type of syste m has its strength s and weaknesses. In the above example, Last.fm requires a
large amo unt of information about a user to make accurate recommend ations. This is an example
of the cold start  problem, and is common in collaborative filtering systems.[12][13][14][15][16][17]
Whereas Pandora needs very little information to start, it is far more limited in scope (for example,
it can only make recommendations that are similar to the original seed).Overview
